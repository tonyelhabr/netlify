+ __Time:__ April 2018 initially, and revisited in July/August 2018
+ __Duration:__ 4 - 6 weeks
+ __Goal(s):__
    + Explore Texas high school academic competition skills.
    + Practice data cleaning and visualization experimentation.
    + Refine R project development skills
    (e.g. using [`{rmarkdown}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html) to create different output formats and [`{knitr}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html) to create child documents).
+ __Deliverable(s):__
    + [A 5-part series of blog posts](/post/analysis-texas-high-school-academics-1-intro) 
    investigating the nature of the competitions themselves,
    the achievements of individual competitors, and 
    the success of schools from  which the competitors come.
    + [A blog post](/post/texas-high-schools-bubble-grid)
    examining different ways to visualize the competition results geo-spatially.
    + [A blog post](/post/texas-high-schools-academics-cors) 
    exploring SAT results and their possible correspondence with the academic 
    competition results.
    + [A blog post](/post/texas-high-schools-academics-fuzzy-join) 
    detailing the challenge of joining data from various sources (with examples).
