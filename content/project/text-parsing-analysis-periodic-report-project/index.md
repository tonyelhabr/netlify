+ __Time:__ Jun. 2019
+ __Duration:__ 3 weeks
+ __Goal(s):__
    + Develop text parsing skills (leveraging the [`{pdftools}` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdftools/pdftools.pdf), the [`{tidytext}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html), and [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)).
    + Experiment with text similarity metrics (e.g. [cosine similarity](https://blog.exploratory.io/demystifying-text-analytics-finding-similar-documents-with-cosine-similarity-e7b9e5b8e515) ) and [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf),
    primarily using the [`{text2vec}` package](http://text2vec.org/)).
    + Develop ["data literacy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_literacy) skills, namely with clear, expressive visualizations.
+ __Deliverable(s):__ [A blog post](/post/text-parsing-analysis-periodic-report) detailing my findings.
