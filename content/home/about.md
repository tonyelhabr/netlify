## Bio

I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX. I completed my undergraduate education 
at the [University of Texas at Austin](www.utexas.edu) in May 2016, receiving a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.
I now live in Round Rock, TX, and work full-time as an Market Operations (Electricity) Engineer at
[Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)](www.ercot.com),
the independent system operator (ISO) for the Texas Bulk Electric System (BES).
I am also currently student in the
[Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Analytics](https://pe.gatech.edu/master-science-degrees/online-master-science-analytics)
(OMSA) degree program (Fall 2018 cohort).

I started this site primarily as a platform where I could share my thoughts on how
analytical techniques can be applied to a
variety of topics. By working on projects (and sharing them with others),
I hope to continuously improve my capabilities as a data scientist.
