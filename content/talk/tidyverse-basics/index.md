I gave this presentation at the second ever meeting of my company's internal 
data science group. After reading [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)'s 
[Teach the Tidyverse to Beginners blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/), 
I urged the other leaders
of the data science group to let me make a presentation about the tidyverse at one
of our first meetings. Lo and behold, David himself found my presentation 
enjoyable--he promoted it in a tweet!
