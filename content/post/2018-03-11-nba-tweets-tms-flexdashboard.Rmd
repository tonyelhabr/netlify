I just wrapped up a mini-project that allowed me to do a handful of things I've
been meaning to do:

+ Try out the [`{flexdashboard}` package](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).
+ Test out my (mostly completed) personal 
[`{tetext}` package](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/tetext) for quick and tidy
text analysis. (It implements a handful of the techniques shown by
[David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) 
and 
[Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/), 
in their blogs and in their
[_Tidy Text Mining with R_ book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).
+ Explore the interaction of social media and the NBA, which is well regarded for leading
the sports industry in engaging fans through modern technological means.
