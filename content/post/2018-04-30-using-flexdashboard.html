<p>I’ve experimented with the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/"><code>flexdashboard</code></a> <code>R</code> package for a couple of things after first trying out not so long ago. In particular, I found the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#storyboards"><code>storyboard</code></a> format to be my favorite. I used it to create the storyboard that I wrote about in a <a href="/post/2018-03-11-nba-tweets-tms-flexdashboard/nba-tms.html">previous post about tracking the activity of NBA team Twitter accounts</a>.</p>

<p>I also used <code>flexdashboard</code> for a presentation that I gave at my company’s data science group.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been experimenting with the storyboard <code>flexdashboard</code> format for visualizing the weekly NFL picks that my brother and I do.</p>

<h2>The Alternatives</h2>
<p>In all, I have found <code>flexdashboard</code>s to be an extremely effective format. It functions as a good compromise among a number of different alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>A “standard” document knitted from a .Rmd file</em></strong> (e.g. HTML, Markdown, Word, or PDF). In my opinion, the main advantage of <code>flexdashboard</code> compared to the traditional .Rmd-<code>knitr</code>-Rmarkdown workflow is the ease with which <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/"><code>shiny</code></a> apps and other interactive formats (e.g. <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/"><code>htmlwidgets</code></a> can be integrated. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>A presentation knitted from a .Rmd file</em></strong> (i.e. a <code>beamer_presentation</code>, <code>ioslides_presentation</code>, <code>slidy_presentation</code>, or a <code>revealjs::revealjs_presentation</code>). Compared to these formats, I have found that modifying the default styling of the base CSS is much simpler with the themes in the <code>flexdashboard</code> package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>A “standard” R presentation</em></strong> (with the .Rpres extension). I must admit that I don’t have much experience with the .Rpres format–I prefer Rmarkdown and the capability that it offers to create different kinds of output from a single “base” file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>A <code>shinydashboard</code></em></strong> (created with the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/"><code>shinydashboard</code></a> package). In comparison to <code>shinydashboard</code>s, I like the “light-weight” framework offered by <code>flexdashboard</code>. While <code>shinydashboard</code> is certainly a better option for developing a complex dashboard (perhaps for a business purpose), this is not typically my use case.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="some-other-opinions" class="section level2">
<h2>Some Other Opinions</h2>
<p>Here’s a couple of my other thoughts and tips for using <code>flexdashboard</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <code>JavaScript</code> functionality is straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I have used the following snippet of code to add functionality for a “toggle” button to show/hide code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  $(&quot;.toggle&quot;).click(function() {
    $(this).toggleClass(&quot;open&quot;);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Customizing the colors and styles (with <code>.css</code>) is also simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>When modifying a theme’s CSS, the typical/recommended approach is to use the browser’s “Inspect” tool (or some browser extension such as <a href="selectorgadget.com/">Selector Gadget</a> to identify which specific styles to adjust.</p>
<p>For example, if the theme that is chosen for the <code>flexdashboard</code> (in particular, the <code>storyboard</code> format) uses the same styling for code and its output, the following CSS code can be used to distinguish the two.</p>
<pre><code>pre.sourceCode.r {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p>To add to this technique, because the CSS files in the <code>flexdashboard</code> package, it’s not too difficult to simply pick out the file for the theme that is being used (see the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/flex_dashboard/resources/"><code>resources/</code> folder</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard">package’s GitHub repo</a>) and quickly identify what to modify.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As if I need to re-iterate it again, I would highly recommend trying out the <code>flexdashboard</code> package. If anything, you’ll learn that you don’t like it.</p>

<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>These can also be be embedded into .html files knitted from a .Rmd file, but I think that it’s more natural in the <code>flexdashboard</code> context. Also, I believe that the HTML format is the only standard .Rmd output format that has interactive capability, so other output formats cannot be used if opting for the <code>knitr</code>-Rmarkdown combo.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
