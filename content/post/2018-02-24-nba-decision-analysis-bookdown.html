<p>I’m happy to announce that I’ve finished converting the bulk of my old posts to an e-book, using the <a href="https://yihui.name/en/">Yihui Xie</a>’s wonderful <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown"><code>bookdown</code> package</a>. The e-book is live <a href="https://tonyelhabr.github.io/nba-decision_analysis/">on the docs branch of a GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>The posts (now chapters) apply concepts in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis">decision analysis</a> to evaluate “value” in the NBA Draft. Although analysis of the NBA draft itself is certainly not novel and , I think my approach is fairly original. Additionally, even though my perspective is not extremely “technical” (there is 0 code in the book), I think the content will serve as a good illustration of how far I have progressed as an analyst when I review and compare it to my level of analysis at any given time now and in the future.</p>
