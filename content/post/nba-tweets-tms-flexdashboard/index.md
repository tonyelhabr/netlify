I just wrapped up a mini-project that allowed me to do a handful of
things I've been meaning to do:

-   Try out the [`{flexdashboard}`
    package](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), which is
    [supposed to be good for prototypying larger
    dashboards](/post/using-flexdashboard) (perhaps created with
    [`{shinydashboard}`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/).
-   Test out my (mostly completed) personal [`{tetext}`
    package](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/tetext) for quick and tidy
    text analysis. (It implements a handful of the techniques shown by
    [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) and [Julia
    Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/), in their blogs and in their
    [*Tidy Text Mining with R* book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).
-   Explore the interaction of social media and the NBA, which is well
    regarded for leading the sports industry in engaging fans through
    modern technological means.
