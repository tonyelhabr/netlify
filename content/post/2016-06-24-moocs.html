<p><a href="https://www.mooc-list.com/">Massive Online Open Courses</a> (MOOCs) are wonderful resources for people like me who have a passion to learn. In a nutshell, they are college-level courses published by reputable universities and/or instructors for free. Some of the most well-known platforms include <a href="www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, but you can also find many courses and related materials directly on university websites or other sites such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I took advantage of several freely available resources, including MOOCs, while developing my skills as a wannabe data analyst.</p>
<p>I’d like to share my thoughts on the five MOOCs that I (mostly) completed during my final semester of undergraduate education at <a href="https://utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>, when I had a fairly light workload. Fair warning–I didn’t finish every single part of every assignment, read every last word of all the reading material, or watch every last second of every lecture video. Nevertheless, I estimate that I completed between 50% to 90% of the material for each MOOC that I discuss, so I think that makes me sufficiently credible to give my opinion.</p>
<p>In the order in which I took them…</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120">1. Udacity’s <em>UD 120: Intro to Machine Learning</em></a></h2>
<p>This was the very first MOOC that I took (sometime in February and March 2016). It served as a great stepping stone for me to develop my <a href="https://www.python.org/"><code>python</code></a> programming skills after learning the basics with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a>’s <code>python</code> course. I wasn’t necessarily interested in learning about machine learning, but I found that trying refine my skills with <code>python</code> beyond the basics with another <code>python</code> tutorial was boring. I needed an application, and this course provided me exactly that. (In retrospect, I realized that I didn’t actually learn much more Along the way, it gave me some familiarity with <code>python</code>’s scikit-learn package, which familiarized me with concepts in applied statistics and provided me with preview of what I would see in the Stanford MOOC that I would take afterwards.</p>

<h2><a href="https://statlearning.class.stanford.edu/">2. Stanford’s <em>Intro to Statistical Learning</em></a></h2>
<p>After I was exposed to a lot of advanced statistical concepts in the previous course, I realized that I should back-track a bit and acquire a firmer understanding of machine learning concepts from a theoretical perspective. <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This course was exactly what I was looking for. <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Not only would it provide me with a solid foundation for understanding higher-level statistics, but it would also provide me a friendly introduction to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code> programming language</a>. Consequently, I gained experience that would allow me to compare the two favorite programming languages for data scientists–<a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html"><code>R</code> and <code>python</code></a>–and see which I prefer. <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Furthermore, after I realized that the <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/getbook.html">textbook</a> was really well-written and realized that the lecture videos were not very entertaining because they mirror the material covered in the text so closely, I abandoned the videos and online quizzes in favor of the reading and lab material. Thus, this course provided a nice change of pace after finishing the heavily video-based Udacity’s <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em> MOOC.</p>

<h2><a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159">3. Yale’s <em>ECON 159: Game Theory</em></a></h2>
<p>Admittedly, this course seems like it doesn’t really belong in the same category as the others. Nevertheless, I believe it is substantial for anyone interesting in learning “analysis” per se. It covers a wide range of subjects related to game theory, but these concepts are always contextualized with the assumptions that must be made and real-world situations to which they can reasonably be applied. This course certainly served as a nice break from programming projects and refined my sense of rationality and deduction capabilities.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> basic knowledge of statistics</li>
<li><strong>Topics:</strong> dominance, Nash equilibrium, mixed strategies, evolutionary stability, sequential games, backward induction, imperfect information, sub-game perfect equilibrium, repeated games, asymmetric information</li>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> 24 lessons with length of 75 min. each, posted lecture notes, optional readings (reading material is recommended only as a supplement for topics that are not made clear from lecture videos and notes)</li>

<h2><a href="http://cs109.github.io/2014/">4. Harvard’s <em>CS 109: Data Science</em></a></h2>
<p>After getting introduced to <code>R</code> with Stanford’s applied statistics class and not having to code at all for Yale’s game theory course, I wanted to make sure that I hadn’t lost any of my knowledge of <code>python</code>. Thus, I found this Harvard course, which put me right back on track with more practice with <code>python</code> and data. <a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It provides lots of instruction on web scraping and data munging, which I hadn’t seen very formally up to that point. Furthermore, after realizing how important illustrations can be for demonstrating new concepts after going through the Stanford course, I knew I could learn a lot from the a lessons on visualization methods offered by this course. Finally, I found the class to be a good re-fresher on machine learning, even though that isn’t necessarily its focus.</p>
<div id="summary-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> basic knowledge of stats and programming (not necessarily <code>python</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Topics:</strong> data manipulation (munging, scraping, sampling, cleaning), data storage (Apache Spark, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Hadoop MapReduce), data visualization, machine learning (regression, classification, clustering), git</li>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> 24 lectures with length of 75 min. each, posted lecture slides, no required readings</li>
<li><strong>Workload:</strong> 5 HWs in the form of <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> Notebooks (~2-3 hrs. per HW with solutions posted separately), 11 labs (same format as HWs), 1 month-long final project</li>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong> students who want to learn how to portray relationships found from machine learning methods in an easy-to-understand way and aren’t afraid of a large workload</li>

<h2><a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html">5. U.C. Berkeley’s <em>CS 188: Artificial Intelligence</em></a></h2>
<p>This is the most recent class that I took. I actually went through it after I graduated (and before the launch of this website.) In comparison to the previous four MOOCs, this course’s discussion of search algorithms, Markov Models, and Bayes’ Nets is unique. Furthermore, It ties in many of the probability, machine learning, and game theory concepts covered in the previous MOOCs and goes into much more depth on some of the topics that were only briefly mentioned in others, such as utilities and reinforcement learning. Finally, this class really stood out to me because the homework assignments and projects (including the multiple-choice questions in the edX modules) were the most difficult of the five MOOCs by a fairly wide margin.</p>
<div id="summary-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> intermediate knowledge data structures, algorithms, and <code>python</code></li>
<li><strong>Topics:</strong> search algorithms (depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), A*, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)), game/utility theory, (minimax, expectimax, utilities, decision diagrams, value of perfect information (VPI)), probability (independence, conditionals, inference) Markov decision processes (Markov models, hidden Markov models, Bayes’ Nets), machine learning (Naive Bayes, perceptrons, clustering)</li>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> 26 lectures with length of 75 min. each, posted lecture slides, optional readings (not recommended because lecture material highlights readings fairly well and sometimes in a different fashion)</li>
<li><strong>Workload:</strong> 10 written HWs (~2-3 hrs./HW) with solutions posted separately, 11 section assignments (same format as HWs), 5 fairly lengthy coding projects, 1 midterm, 1 final</li>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong> students who love computer science and robotics</li>
<li><strong>Completion Time:</strong> ~12-14 weeks at ~2-2.5 hrs./day (or ~15-20 hrs./week)</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 5/5</li>
<li><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</li>
<li>__Pro:__in-depth instruction on advanced probability</li>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Of course, there are many other great MOOCs related to programming, probability, and data science out there. In fact, there were several other MOOCs that I “test-piloted” in my process of learning to become more than just a newbie data analyst. However, these other ones that I found simply didn’t fit what I was hoping to learn at the time. As I note in the paragraph above the “Summary” section of each course, each of the five MOOCs that I have listed here served a specific purpose for me while I was building my knowledge base.</p>
<p>For those aspiring data analysts out there, maybe you will follow the path that I have laid out here. I hope your find these classes helpful in your pursuit to become a better data analyst as well. However, no matter what path you choose, I hope you all have success in reaching your goals!</p>
