I'm happy to announce that I've finished converting the bulk of my old posts
to an e-book, using the [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/)'s 
wonderful [`bookdown` package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
The e-book is live [on the docs branch of a GitHub repo](https://tonyelhabr.github.io/nba-decision_analysis/).


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

```

The posts (now chapters) apply concepts in the field 
of [decision analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis)
to evaluate "value" in the NBA Draft. Although analysis of the NBA draft
itself is certainly not novel and ,
I think my approach is fairly original. Additionally, even though
my perspective is not extremely "technical" (there is 0 code in the book),
I think the content will serve as a good illustration of how far I have progressed
as an analyst when I review and compare it to my level of analysis
at any given time now and in the future.
