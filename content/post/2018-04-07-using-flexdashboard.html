<p>I‚Äôve experimented with the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/"><code>flexdashboard</code></a> <code>R</code> package for a couple of things after first trying out not so long ago. In particular, I have found the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#storyboards"><code>storyboard</code></a> format to be my favorite. I used it to create the storyboard that I wrote about in a previous post, and I even used it for a presentation that I gave at my company‚Äôs data science group. (Unforunately, I can‚Äôt share that presentation üò¢.)</p>
<p>In all, I have found it to be an extremely effective format. It functions as a good compromise among a number of different output formats, includting</p>
<ul>
<li>a ‚Äústandard‚Äù document (HTML, Markdown, Word, or PDF) knitted from a .Rmd file;</li>
<li>a presentation knitted from a .Rmd file; (i.e.¬†a <code>beamer_presentation</code>, <code>ioslides_presentation</code>, <code>slidy_presentation</code>, or a <code>revealjs::revealjs_presentation</code>);</li>
<li>a ‚Äústandard‚Äù R presentation (with the .Rpres extension); and</li>
<li>a <code>shinydashboard</code> (created with the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/"><code>shinydashboard</code></a> package.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, it‚Äôs main advantage compared to the traditional .Rmd-<code>knitr</code>/<code>rmarkdown</code> workflow is the ease with which <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/"><code>shiny</code></a> apps and other interactive formats (e.g. <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/"><code>htmlwidgets</code></a> can be integrated. (These can also be be emebedded into .html files knitted from a .Rmd file, but I think that it‚Äôs more natural in the <code>flexdashboard</code> context. Also, the HTML format is the only standard .Rmd output format that has interactive capability.) Compared to the .Rmd presentation formats, I have found that modifying the default styling of the base is much simpler. Regarding the .Rpres format, I must admit that I don‚Äôt have much experience with it‚ÄìI prefer Rmarkdown and the capability that it offers to create different kinds of output from a single ‚Äúbase‚Äù file. And, in comparison to <code>shinydashboard</code>s, I like the ‚Äúlight-weight‚Äù framework offered by <code>flexdashboard</code>. While <code>shinydashboard</code> is certainly a better option for developing a complex dashboard (perhaps for a business purpose), that is not typically what I need when working on my own projects or a small project for another audience.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a couple of my other thoughts/tips for using <code>flexdashboard</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <code>JavaScript</code> functionality is straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I have used the following snippet of code to add functionality for a ‚Äútoggle‚Äù button to show/hide code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  $(&quot;.toggle&quot;).click(function() {
    $(this).toggleClass(&quot;open&quot;);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Customizing the colors and styles (with <code>.css</code>) is also simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>When modifying a theme‚Äôs CSS, the typical/recommended approach is to use the browser‚Äôs ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù tool (or some browser extension such as <a href="selectorgadget.com/">Selector Gadget</a> to identify which specific styles to adjust.</p>
<p>For example, if the theme that is chosen for the <code>flexdashboard</code> (in particular, the <code>storyboard</code> format) uses the same styling for code and its output, the following CSS code can be used to distinguish the two.</p>
<pre><code>pre.sourceCode.r {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p>To add to this technique, because the CSS files in the <code>flexdashboard</code> package, it‚Äôs not too difficult to simply pick out the file for the theme that is being used (see the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/flex_dashboard/resources/"><code>resources/</code> folder</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard">package‚Äôs GitHub repo</a>) and quickly identify what to modify.</p>
