## Conference Take-Aways

The main thing I'm taking away from my experience at the conference
(and the [`{tidyverse}` Developer Day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/)
afterwards) is this:
[the `R` community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is as 
**passionate** and **compassionate** as it is online.

![](https://github.com/rstudio/learning-r-survey/blob/master/plots/R%20Capabilities%20Users%20Like%20Best%20(R%20Users%20Only).pdf)

By "passionate", I mostly mean how people are driven to address
the problems of the community---both the `R` programming community and society
at large---via packages, teaching others, conducting projects to help
not-for-profit organizations, etc.

By "compassionate", I'm referring to how friendly and considerate everyone is.
I never had an easier time striking up conversations with strangers than I did
at the conference! (As a natural introvert, this was a very different kind
of thing for me.)
I truly got the feeling that everyone was excited to hear what 
others were working on, more so than customary "politeness"
might call for. [^#]

[^#] While it's normal for individuals
to patienly sit throught to what others have to say
in organized settings such as a conference---whether it be 
listening to a presenter or in discussions outside of presentations---from
my experience, it's certainly **not** the case that people always actively 
absorb what they hear.
more so than one might be as a well-manered individual.

These two superlatives---passion and compassion---
were expressed perhaps most prominently via
the manner in which speakers who gave talks discussingw
their own work were eager to highlight how they
were either assisted or inspired by others.


## Miscellanous Tidbits

+ Speaking as one who went into industry immediately after getting
my undergraduate degree (although now I'm working on getting my Master's
while I work full-time), I was impressed by the "nobility" of those 
in academia. I spoke with several current PhD students who discussed
how their efforts to give back to the open-source community (and
society at large) through the research projects that they are working on.
+ This is not to say anything "bad" about industry folk. All of the industry
people who I interacted with expressed interest in giving back to the
community (and, if they are already doing so, doing it even more).

+ Meetin Carl Howe @cdhowe, Jim Hester @jimhester_, Amelia McNamara @AmeliaMN,
Dewey Dunnington @paleolimbot, Ryo Nakagaware @R_by_Ryo

+ Mara has a daily morning report, just like I run some scripts every morning
to fetch sports data.
+ All of the presenters that I saw were very good speakers. 
Maybe there is some bias because R is heavily tied to academia, and more
than a handful of speakers have teaching backgrounds (so they are
more likely to be comfortable in front of large audiences and expressing
their thoughts well). Even then, those without teaching backgrounds
were so good (e.g. Joe Cheng).
+ `{glue}` package was originally going to be named `{fstring}`
+ For the first time, met someone who had never directly communicated with before
who knew me from my blog. It turns out that I knew him too.
+ Talked with the creator of the `{ggspatial}` package about some
of the challenges he faced as a developer.

## Random Thoughts

+ Got FOMO? I'll tell you something---you get the same feeling even when attending
becasue there are so many great things to attend and people to talk to that you
don't end up having enough time to do it all!

+ It would be really nice to have a voice that projects well :smile:. As one
who does not have such a voice, I feel like I have to yell just to get people
to hear me.

+ Unless perhaps if you're "Twitter famous", don't forget your business cards!

+ Coffee and churros make for a great combination!
