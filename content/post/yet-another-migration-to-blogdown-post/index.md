As of today, I've officially made the jump to using the `R` package
`blogdown` (which uses the `Hugo` static-site generator under the hood)
for my personal website. Previously, I had been using WordPress for my
blogging purposes. In sync with the change in platform, I'm changing the
name of this site from "Number Sense" (www.numbersense.org) to something
involving my name (Tony ElHabr). Nonetheless, my original intents to
write about math, sports, and data-related things have not changed.
Perhaps the only major difference with me between now and then is my
developed passion for programming, especially with `R`.

I'll eventually get around to cleaning up my handful of old posts and
sharing them here. (I used a WordPress to Hugo converter for the basic
conversion, but there were still lots of links and formatting to be
fixed <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0>.)

To kick of my sit migration, I suppose I could write a tutorial to
explain how or why I'm transitioning, but it seems like everyone does
that <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>, so I don't want to re-invent the
wheel. Aside from individual write-up, the wonderful [blogdown
book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) should be sufficient for
most people's purposes.

Although I would like to blog on a regular basis, my job comes first for
me---so if I don't have time to blog, then I might not post anything for
months at a time.
