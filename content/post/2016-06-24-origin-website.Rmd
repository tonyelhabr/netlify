__NOTE TO READER:__
This post was written in reference to my previous attempt at a blog,
which was named Number (Non-)Sense. Nevertheless, nearly all that is written
remains true.

In this post I detail the origin of this website. I first describe 
my personal background before discussing how my interests 
manifested into this website.

## Born to be an Engineer

Born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in a nearby suburb with my 
twin brother Andrew, I am extremely grateful to have two parents 
who provided me with anything that I could ever want. They each 
come from very different cultural backgrounds, yet they managed 
to 
find each other when attending the 
[University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu/) (UT Austin), 
from where they both graduated with 
degrees in civil engineering. Interest in embracing my 
multi-cultural heritage and in tuning into the intelligence 
passed 
down to me prompted me to partake in challenging
[International Baccalaureate](http://www.ibo.org/) (IB) 
classes in high school. These higher-level 
classes helped me achieve my academic potential, and the diverse 
nature of the IB curriculum exposed me to a wide-range of topics 
that captivated me, including physics and electronics. 
Consequently, I chose to major in electrical engineering when I 
began my undergraduate education at UT in August 2012.

Throughout my four years at UT, I found my classes challenging and 
enriching, my professors knowledgeable and engaging, and my 
fellow 
students friendly and hard-working. To sum up my extracurricular 
activities, I served as a member and officer in professional 
societies such as the UT student branch of
[Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers](ttps://www.ieee.org/) (IEEE), 
worked as 
night-time department tutor for two classes over the course of two 
semesters, and completed three separate internships during my 
undergraduate tenure. All of these experiences re-affirmed my 
passion for problem-solving and the engineering discipline in 
general.


## Lessons of Independence

It's a bit hard to pinpoint exactly when I really picked up the 
wish to create an online home for my thoughts on topics that 
interest me. I think it probably dates back to when I moved out 
to 
live by myself for the first time after earning an internship for 
spring 2013. That period of time turned out to be life-changing 
for me.

As I alluded to before, I had been well-cared for up to that point 
of my life. I was raised by two loving (and perhaps 
over-protective) parents in the same town up through the end of 
high school, and I only moved 50 miles away to go to college in 
Austin, where I shared a living space with my twin brother. 
Thus, when I moved out for my first internship, it was the first 
time I was got to experience what it is like to be independent. 
Moving away for college and having to do my laundry seemed like 
nothing in comparison. Paying for a car, rent, and utilities 
while 
living in a poor urban environment was all-new to me. 
Nevertheless, I took this time as an opportunity for self-growth.

I tried to improve my amateur-at-best skills at cooking, 
explored body-weight training to keep myself in shape without a 
gym nearby, and read about being financially responsible. Most 
importantly, I began reading online "self-help" resources and 
found an interest in being as "efficient" as possible in all 
matters of life. Blogs like Thomas Frank's [College Info Geek](http://collegeinfogeek.com/) 
website fed a new-found passion for productivity within me. 
Likewise, Pat Flynn's [Smart Passive Income](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/) media 
conglomerate introduced me the idea of entrepreneurship and other 
ideas related to personal branding. ^[Of course, these weren't the 
only sources of inspiration for me. Perhaps I will discuss other 
people and resources that I drew inspiration from in a later 
post.] Through sources like these, I realized that having 
an online repository to demonstrate the work that one has 
accomplished and capture one's personality could be an extremely 
useful tool for networking and finding future job opportunities.

However, I never actually got around to starting a website during 
my time in college. Fortunately, I still managed to get two other 
internships and earn a full-time job after graduation even 
without 
a website to serve as an online portfolio. Yet, even after I had 
secured a full-time job during my penultimate semester at UT in 
fall 2015, I realized that I still had an interest in making a 
website. However, my intent for a potential website was no longer 
to try to promote personal projects or ideas explicitly for 
earning an engineering job, but for simply participating in the 
anyone in the massive community that is the Internet that might 
share my interests.

## Defining my Interests

I was set on creating an online hub where I could share my ideas 
primarily on the two things that interest me the 
most--numbers (i.e. data analysis and math) and sports. You 
might be wondering, "Where did these two interests come 
from?"

### Numbers

In consideration of my background in engineering, the "numbers" 
part isn't too hard to explain. I won't bore you with all the 
details of how much of a nerd I was in middle and high school, 
where I competed (and succeeded) in math competitions. However, 
aside from personal education, my twin brother's path in college 
also strongly influenced me. ^[Perhaps he will go into more 
detail to it later in his explanation of his background.] 
Andrew followed a fairly unique track in his pursuit of a B.S. in 
Mechanical Engineering at UT. He took classes with fancy-sounding 
words like "Decision Analysis" and "Game Theory" in their 
titles--as well as other graduate-level 
math-based courses--that put him in line with the 
post-undergraduate degree that he is now pursuing in the field of 
Operations Research at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/). Often he would toy with 
me by asking me some of his homework questions just to see how 
incorrectly I would respond. Nevertheless, in doing so, he 
unknowingly piqued my interest in some of the things that he was 
studying (although not to the point where I felt obliged to 
switch 
paths after having finished three of four years counting towards 
my degree). So that's where the "numbers" interest was born and 
refined.

### Sports

My passion for sports is perhaps a bit more confounding to the 
reader. Even though I haven't mentioned it up to this point, my 
brother and I had always been a big fan of sports growing up. 
Although our parents never played and hardly watched sports 
themselves, they encouraged us to embrace our passion for sports 
by signing us up to play with youth basketball, soccer, and 
baseball teams throughout the school year, as well as sending us 
to golf and tennis camps during the summer. We played sports 
year-round up through the beginning of high school in 2008, when 
we dropped these activities to focus on in-class learning. 
Nevertheless, as more and more time passed after I gave up 
playing 
organized sports, my interest in reading and analyzing them grew 
stronger.

Accordingly, I scoured the Internet to find stories and websites 
who could feed my hunger for data-based analysis. Articles on 
[ESPN](http://espn.go.com/)'s website that went beyond simply reporting the 
outcomes of games--such as those which tried to predict 
winners and provided rationale for these picks--became 
increasingly attractive. Also, after having followed the writings 
of well-known sports and media figure [Bill Simmons](https://twitter.com/BillSimmons) since 
middle school, I became an avid reader of [Grantland](http://grantland.com/) (which 
was associated with ESPN) after its launch in 2011, The NFL and 
NBA columns of [Bill Barnwell](https://twitter.com/billbarnwell) and [Zach Lowe](https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA) at 
Grantland were weekly must-reads for me. However, I found that I 
still wanted more. ^[More recently, the sports 
section at [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538)'s 
[FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) website 
has become a main-stay favorite of mine.]

During that period of time when I moved out on my own for an 
internship in spring 2013 and had spare time after work to do 
whatever I pleased, I looked beyond the ESPN online realm and 
found other websites that fit my search for in-depth sports 
coverage. [Brian Burke](https://twitter.com/bburkeespn)'s 
[Advanced Football Analytics](http://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com) 
and the NBA coverage of [Nylon Calculus](http://nyloncalculus.com/) fed 
my hunger for sports saber-metrics. ^[As with the resources that 
inspired me during that first time that I lived by myself, 
perhaps 
I will discuss some of my other favorite websites to read on a 
regular basis in a later post.] I filtered out the popular, 
yet low-level sports analysis that was disguised as 
intelligent--like [Peter King](https://twitter.com/SI_PeterKing)'s weekly "Monday 
Morning Quarterback" column--as well as highly subjective 
content provided by ESPN itself--including its popular 
television show "[First Take](https://twitter.com/FirstTake)". My inclination 
for 
data and empirical evidence taught me how to separate the good 
and 
bad analysis.

Thus, with a set-in-stone intent to create a website of some 
sorts, a fair background in mathematics due to my engineering 
college education, and with an ever-increasing desire to analyze 
sports at a deeper level than the average fan, it became obvious 
to me that threading data and sports together could be the focus 
of a future website.

## Getting Technical

Nevertheless, before I could feel comfortable posting any kind of 
original content concerning numbers and sports with analysis, I 
believed that I needed to improve my technical skills. It wasn't 
so much the "sports" aspect that I was concerned about, but more 
so the "numbers" part. Even with my background in electrical 
engineering, I didn't feel that I had significant enough 
experience with programming because I had avoided most courses 
related to computer science topics in school. Also, I knew that 
it 
couldn't hurt to refresh and enhance my knowledge of probability 
and statistics, despite succeeding in a variety of advanced math 
courses at UT.

I had taken courses teaching assembly language, C, and C++ 
(primarily in the context of their application to embedded 
systems), but that about summed up the totality of my coding 
skills prior to my last semester of college at the beginning of 
2016. I felt that I needed more practice with programming for 
applications outside of embedded systems.

### Programming

After looking up what tools statisticians and data scientists use 
to conduct their analyses, I discovered that [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and 
[`python`](https://www.python.org/) are the two most popular programming languages for 
this field of study. Interestingly, there seemed to be no real 
consensus as to which is better. ^[As many experienced 
programmers will attest when comparing programming languages, its 
more about the programmer and his preferences and capabilities 
than about the features of the language itself. Just about any 
language can be used to do perform the same tasks as 
another.] Anyways, in trying to distinguish the two, I read 
that `R` and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) shared some commonalities with 
[`MATLAB`](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and its interactive development environment (IDE), 
with which I had a semester's worth of experience. As for `python`, 
I found that most perceive it as a better object-oriented 
language 
than `Java` (which I was originally intent on learning before 
looking up alternatives), and that, more generally, `python` is one 
of the easiest languages to pick up. Not wanting to spend 
eternity 
weighing the pros and cons of `R` versus `python` ^[which many others 
have 
done], I made a rather arbitrary decision and picked `python `
(perhaps just because it sounds cooler).

I started out simple by taking [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s `python`
tutorial. ^[Codeacademy is often cited as 
great starting point for beginner programmers, I took 
Codeacademy's `JavaScript` course back when I was in high school 
and 
wanted to investigate computer science. After finding that the `JavaScript` course was engaging, 
I concluded that Codeacademy was 
a good go-to resource for learning the basics of any other 
programming language that I might want to learn in the 
future.] Then, after quickly finishing it, I looked for a 
higher-level, more formal online course that I could take to help 
improve my knowledge of the language. I found a couple of good 
resources, but I quickly became bored with all of them because I 
felt that there was no way I was going to every apply `python` in 
the way that it was taught. I had long read that the best way to 
learn a programming language is to apply it to something that 
really interests you, and never did it feel more true than at 
that 
point in time.

Consequently, I decided to attempt to use `python` in the way that I 
imagined I might eventually use it for conduction analyses for 
this site. In particular, I wrote programs to scrape and compare 
daily NBA scores and betting lines from ESPN's website in order 
to 
get an idea of how bookmakers and gamblers might be faring. 
Furthermore, I scraped the scores of every game from past NBA 
seasons in order to compare them to win totals that I had 
recorded 
in personal spreadsheets for a couple of years. After I had spent 
a week or so writing a couple of scripts to perform tasks and get 
data that I was interested in, I felt that I had improved my 
comfort-level with `python` substantially. Common scientific `python`
packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `beautifulsoup` 
became familiar to me. Furthermore, I also used this time to 
teach 
myself how to utilize other tools like the command prompt, git, 
and [IPython](https://ipython.org/).

### Mathematics

Then, with my improved sense of confidence in my programming 
abilities, I turned my attention to learning advanced mathematics 
(mostly concerning statistics and probability), as well as 
decision analysis techniques. After failing to find a formal 
`python` class that could hold my attention a couple of weeks 
before, I once again searched to find a structured online course 
that could meet my goals for non-programming learning. At the 
same 
time, I would have been even more pleased to have found a course 
that combined instruction on mathematics and analysis with 
programming in `python` (or `R`). To my delight, I was able to settle 
on a course--namely, 
[Udacity's UD 120: Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)--that 
satisfied these desires. ^["Settle" is an apt 
verb choice here--there are so many free online classes and 
open-source learning resources available that picking just one to 
start with can be difficult, especially for a perfectionist like 
me who might be left wondering if there is a better 
alternative.] I won't go into too much detail here about 
this course and the four other [Massive Online Open Courses](https://www.mooc-list.com/)
(MOOCs) that I took afterwards because probably that 
deserves its own write-up. Anyways, to summarize their 
collective effect, the MOOCs provided me a significant amount of 
confidence in my technical capabilities.

## The Inception

Thus, by summer 2016, I had gained a much better understanding of 
the effort and knowledge needed to serve as a reputable data 
scientist. Even though I skimmed through much of the content in 
the the five MOOCs that I completed between the sometime a couple 
of weeks before spring break time in March 2016 and the inception 
of this website in the middle of 2016, I finally felt capable of 
starting a website. Thus, with this sense of self-confidence, 
along with my ongoing passion for sports, numbersense.org was 
born.


Choosing the moniker "Number (Non-)Sense" involved a 
couple day's worth of throwing ideas back-and-forth with my 
brother before coming to a settlement. Although the name might 
seem a bit bland or uninspiring, we both agreed that having some 
kind of over-the-top, ground-breaking label isn't all too 
important. In the end, we realize that we will be judged by the 
quality of the content that we produce, which we hope you will 
enjoy.

Anyways, that's all I have to say in this way-too-long back-story 
detailing the origin of this website. ^[ You might come to notice 
that  I like to write in a very elaborate and sometimes unnecessarily 
long fashion. The previous sentence is a perfect example of that. 
I realize that this style doesn't really lend itself to top-notch 
analysis and isn't highly regarded in this discipline. I assure 
you that one of my goals with this website is to learn to write 
more concisely (which is imminent for my actual full-time job) 
and improve as technical writer in every way possible.]
