# Things to do

- Migrate "Software", "Presentaitons", and "Misc" pages from old website.
- Check dead links.
- Clean up "unused" custom CSS.
    - Unused .css files.
    - "Extra" code in used .css file that are being ignored (possibly due to upgrade in
    Academic theme version).

<!--# Introduction

There's been lots of great content in the [`{tidymodels}`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) world recently: [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) has been pumping out tutorials on using the package with [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) data on a nearly weekly basis on her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTTBgWyJl2HrrhQOOc710kA) and [blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/), Julia has published [a free class on supervised machine learning](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app/); the community has been writing up helpful blog posts, e.g. [this](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-03-25_machine_learning/), [this](https://hansjoerg.me/2020/02/09/tidymodels-for-machine-learning/), and [this](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-02-27-better-tidymodels/); and even [the website got a make-over](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/tidymodels-org/) (thanks primarily to [Alison Hill](https://twitter.com/apreshill)).

Personally, I've found that integrating `{tidymodels}` has made the whole machine learning EDA and workflow much smoother. There-->
